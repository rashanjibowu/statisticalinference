## Welcome

This repository holds code for 2 projects for the Coursera Statistical Inference course. The first project is an exploration, via simulation, of the exponential distribution. The [second project](statisticalinference/toothgrowth/toothgrowth.md) is an analysis of the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in guinea pigs.
